i have SPA approach in my alpinejs where index.html is my main page and i have pages folder which this folder contains nth level of multiple directories and files on it. Every time a menu is selected it auto routes the path where the file is fetch. that page including its content will inject to the main page. this client app is used to fetch data from api server so i have to globally configure for environment variable that some variable is wide accessible like api base url. show me how it can work and each of the pages under pages folder should its own script that also need to execute.
